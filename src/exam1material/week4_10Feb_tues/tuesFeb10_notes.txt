HW 3 due tonight

    #5: p ∨ q ∨ r ⊢ r ∨ q ∨ p

    What will the structure be?

        p ∨ q ∨ r: top-level is the rightmost or
        //(p ∨ q) ∨ r

        Try OrE on premise
        SubProof: assume p ∨ q

            goal: r ∨ q ∨ p
            top-level is the rightmost Or
            could introduce OR if have r ∨ q
                or if I had p

            nested OrE
            SubProof: assume p 
                goal: r ∨ q ∨ p
                r ∨ q ∨ p by OrI2()

            SubProof: assume q 
                goal: r ∨ q ∨ p
                first get r ∨ q
                then get r ∨ q ∨ p

        SubProof: assume r

            goal: r ∨ q ∨ p

Logika features/tips

- renumber/reformat proofs

General proof strategy to this point

<<<<<<< HEAD
1 list premises
2 before thinking about conclusion, break down premises to get extra info
3 look at conclusion
4 consider if you will need OrE( probably will if you have an or statement)
5 thing anout order of operation
=======
1) list premises
2) break down any premises you can to get extra information

3) look at the conclusion

4) consider if you will need OrE (probably will if you have an OR)

Always consider order of operations!

How to prove two propositional logic statements are 
equivalent?

<<<<<<< HEAD
    Approach 1:
for every truth assignemnt they both have the same output
=======
    Approach 1: two truth tables
        for every possible truth assignment, the two
        statements have the same output

>>>>>>> 25ace0d34688315e4ccd9a89aebdc734c169004f
    Approach 2:
        deduction with two proofs
        statement1 |- statement2
        statement2 |- statement1




How to prove propositional logic statements are 
NOT equivalent?

<<<<<<< HEAD
find one truth assigment that is different
can't use deduction
=======
    find ONE truth assignment where the two statements
    have different outpu

    can't use deduction to prove not equivalent

>>>>>>> 25ace0d34688315e4ccd9a89aebdc734c169004f

What is satisfiability? 
need to prove where the statement output is true

    need ONE truth assignment where the statement outputs true
    (if we did a truth table, would be a tautology or contingent)

To show NOT satisfiable?

    need FULL truth table to show the statement always outputs false
    (i.e., is contradictory)


- Determining whether an argument is valid or invalid
    (what is an argument?)

        premises, conclusion

    valid: 
<<<<<<< HEAD
    the statement works for every assignemnt
    how prove valid?
    every truth table assigment follows law
=======
        if for every truth assignment where all premises are true,
        the conclusion is also true

    how prove valid?
        1) truth table with all premises and conclusion
        look at truth assignments that make all premises true,
        make sure they make the conclusion true

        2) deduction
>>>>>>> 25ace0d34688315e4ccd9a89aebdc734c169004f

    1. truth table

    2. deduction
    how prove invalid?
<<<<<<< HEAD
    find one where it does not follow law
=======

        find ONE truth assignment where all premises true
        but conclusion false

        can't prove invalid with deduction

>>>>>>> 25ace0d34688315e4ccd9a89aebdc734c169004f

Closed notes/computers.


Mix of multiple choice (like quizzes) and open-ended 
    (like homework)

Some problems will ask for a proof or explanation --
    read carefully!
