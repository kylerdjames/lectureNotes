HW 3 due tonight

    #5: p ∨ q ∨ r ⊢ r ∨ q ∨ p

    What will the structure be?


    How to build conclusion?





Exam 1 is Thursday, February 12
    Exam review session (by Erik and Drake):
        Wednesday, February 11, 2:30-5:00 pm in DUE 1118

No new homework this week

/////////////////////

Today:
- more involved natural deduction examples
- exam 1 review

/////////////////////

Reminder: implies-elimination, ImplyE

          P,P → Q
ImplyE: -----------
            Q



Implies symbol.

Typing a → in Logika for natural deduction:

    __>:

(two underscores, >, :)

//////////////////////////

Bigger examples: ex1.sc, ex2.sc, ex3.sc


/////////////////////////

Logika features/tips

- see proof step summary
- renumber/reformat proofs
- interpreting errors


/////////////////////////

General proof strategy to this point

1 list premises
2 before thinking about conclusion, break down premises to get extra info
3 look at conclusion
4 consider if you will need OrE( probably will if you have an or statement)
5 thing anout order of operation

/////////////////////////

(in-class quiz)

Exam 1 review.

Covers everything we've done up to this point 
(including today).


See Canvas announcement for list of topics.




How to prove two propositional logic statements are 
equivalent?

    Approach 1:
for every truth assignemnt they both have the same output
    Approach 2:




How to prove propositional logic statements are 
NOT equivalent?

find one truth assigment that is different
can't use deduction

What is satisfiability? 
need to prove where the statement output is true



- Determining whether an argument is valid or invalid
    (what is an argument?)
    valid: 
    the statement works for every assignemnt
    how prove valid?
    every truth table assigment follows law

    1. truth table

    2. deduction
    how prove invalid?
    find one where it does not follow law

/////////////////////////////////////////

Closed notes/computers.


Mix of multiple choice (like quizzes) and open-ended (like homework)

Some problems will ask for a proof or explanation --
    read carefully!
